This set of m-files demonstrates the FastESC clustering algorithm and the Extended Basic Matrix Multiplication algorithm in [1].  

"demoFastESC.m" shows FastESC on Iris dataset.

"demoFastESC_EMNIST.m" shows FastESC on EMNIST-Digits dataset.

"demo_BMM.m" shows the Basic Matrix Multiplication algorithm in
P. Drineas, R. Kannan, and M. W. Mahoney, "Fast monte carlo algorithms for matrices i: Approximating matrix multiplication," SIAM Journal on Computing, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 132-157, 2006.

"demo_EBMM.m" shows the Extended Basic Matrix Multiplication algorithm, or Algorithm 1 and Theorem 1 in [1].

Run those demos in Matlab.
